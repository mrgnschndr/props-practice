## Lab Overview

1. Create and clone down a repository called `props-practice`
2. Add the provided code to your project and do an initial commit. NOTE: Do not commit until you CONFIRM you have a .gitignore file so that you don't push up your node_modules folder!
3. Create tickets for each task.
4. For each task, create and switch to a branch called `task-<number>`
5. Complete the task, push up to GitHub, create a PR, and merge to main.
6. In your terminal, checkout back to main and complete a fresh pull.
7. Don't forget to link your repo in our 1-1 chat.

## To run the project locally:

- You will need to install the dependencies I've added to the project. `npm i`
- You can start the react application using `npm run start`

## Instructions 

You have TEN (10) functionality tasks to fix or complete which are explained by comments in the code. Remember you can search a file or entire codebase. The pattern you will search for is: `Task <number here>`. Once you have restored all functionality with the ten tasks, you have additional Styling Tasks below.

I recommend starting with index.js, and then work your way through the files. Familiarize yourself with the flow, modules, and data being used.

## Styling Tasks 
- Task 11: Ensure all photos are cropped to the same ratio.

- Task 12: On desktop, display a 2x grid of posts. (Meaning two posts can sit side-by-side, with each additional row also containing a maximum of two posts.)

- Task 13: Using CSS `media queries`, ensure tablet and mobile views only show one post per row (a single column of posts)

## Stretch Goals: 

- Make the lab fully responsive.
